    <p class="page-subtitle">Episode Guide: Real-World Stories Behind the Colors</p>

    <article class="content-card">
      <p>Growing up on 80s cartoons, I absorbed a lot of messages about friendship, courage, and teaming up with people who were different from you. Shows like <em>Rainbow Brite</em>, <em>She-Ra</em>, and <em>Care Bears</em> treated every adventure like an “episode” where characters learned something new about themselves and the world around them.</p>

      <p>My real life never came with a theme song, but my time working in the global bicycle industry sometimes felt a little like that episode structure. Each experience revealed something about culture, values, and connection in the global economy — whether it was a small act of kindness in an email, a gift that carried deep cultural meaning, or a crisis that exposed very different ideas about responsibility and ethics.</p>

      <p>This page is a landing zone for those “episodes.” Each story below links out to a more detailed look at one cultural experience that helped shape how I see the world.</p>

      <h2>Featured Cultural “Episodes”</h2>

          <h3>Episode 1: A Tang WaWa Doll from RoyalBaby</h3>
          <p>A beautifully crafted Tang WaWa doll, gifted by our Chinese vendor RoyalBaby, became much more than a decorative object. As I learned about its story and symbolism, it turned into a lens for understanding generosity, tradition, and the way material culture carries meaning across borders.</p>

          <h3>Episode 2: Cherry Blossoms in the Inbox</h3>
          <p>What started as routine weekly reports to Minoura LTD in Japan turned into a quiet friendship built on photos of cherry blossoms, fishing trips, and everyday life. These exchanges showed me how cross-cultural connection can grow out of simple, consistent, human moments.</p>

          <h3>Episode 3: COVID-19, PPE & Cultural Values</h3>
          <p>During the early months of COVID-19, overseas partners sent us PPE at their own expense, while a long-time U.S. vendor hoarded supplies and inflated prices. Experiencing those responses side by side changed how I think about culture, ethics, and what it means to care for others in a crisis.</p>

      <h2>Why These Stories Matter</h2>
      <p>In 80s cartoons, the world usually became a little brighter by the end of each episode — not because problems magically disappeared, but because characters understood each other better. My cultural experiences in the global economy have worked the same way. Each one added a bit more nuance, empathy, and awareness to how I move through the world.</p>

      <p>These stories remind me that the global economy is more than shipping containers and spreadsheets. It’s people sending photos of spring blossoms, vendors quietly mailing PPE halfway around the world, and gifts that arrive wrapped in layers of history and meaning. Together, they create a rainbow of experiences that continues to shape how I see culture, connection, and my place in a global community.</p>
