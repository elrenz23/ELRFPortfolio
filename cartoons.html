      <p class="page-subtitle">How 80s Animation Colored My Ideas About Friendship, Courage, and Justice</p>

      <article class="content-card">

        <p>Long before I had the language of “global citizenship,” “cultural identity,” or even “neurodivergence,” I had cartoons. The 80s animated shows I grew up with were more than background noise; they were some of my earliest teachers. They told stories about friendship, fairness, standing up to bullies, and caring about people who were different from you. They showed me colorful worlds where community mattered and where kindness even in the face of fear or uncertainty could change things.</p>

        <p>Looking back, I can see how much those shows shaped the way I think about connection and responsibility. They planted early seeds of the ideas I’m now studying more formally in human sciences and global citizenship. This page highlights a few of the series that left a lasting mark on how I see the world.</p>

        <h2>What They Taught Me</h2>

        <p><strong>Rainbow Brite</strong> was all about bringing color and light back to places that had gone gray and dull. That idea of adding color to the world instead of just fitting into it still resonates with me. It connects directly to how I think about making systems more humane and adding care into the work I do.</p>

        <p><strong>Care Bears</strong> leaned hard into emotional literacy before I ever heard that term. The show made feelings visible and important, and it framed caring about others as a kind of strength. That perspective shows up now in how I think about empathy as a core part of global citizenship.</p>

        <p><strong>My Little Pony</strong> often centered on community, cooperation, and the complications of friendship. There were conflicts and misunderstandings, but the resolution usually involved listening, compromise, and mutual respect. Those themes echo through much of my work and study today.</p>


        <h2>From Childhood Shows to Adult Frameworks</h2>
        <p>On the surface, these were just cartoons with bright colors, catchy theme songs, and toy lines. But underneath, they quietly normalized the idea that the world is bigger than your immediate surroundings, that other people’s well-being matters, and that standing up for what’s right is worth the effort, even when it’s uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>Now, as I study global citizenship, cultural identity, and systems that shape people’s lives, I can see how those early messages stayed with me. They’re part of why I’m drawn to questions about fairness, inclusion, and connection. In a way, the work I’m doing now is just a more complex, grown-up version of the same story: trying to add more color, care, and courage to the world I’m part of.</p>
