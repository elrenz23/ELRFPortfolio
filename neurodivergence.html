        <h2>Understanding My Brain</h2>
        <p>I didn’t grow up with the word “neurodivergent.” What I knew was that my brain didn’t quite work the same way as many of the people around me. In high school, that didn’t feel like a problem—if anything, it felt like a strength. I rarely had to study, I could pick up information just by being in the room, and the patterns in the material were usually clear enough that I could connect the dots on my own.</p>

        <p>College was different. At Iowa State, the structure of university life changed everything. Lectures were larger, expectations were more abstract, and the patterns in how classes were run weren’t as obvious. There were more sensory inputs, more distractions, and more unspoken rules to decode. The academics themselves weren’t necessarily harder, but the environment was. I went from “this comes naturally” to “why is this so difficult for me when everyone else seems to be keeping up?” long before I had language for why.</p>

        <h2>Not Fitting the “Normal” Template</h2>
        <p>Being neurodivergent often means feeling like everyone else got a rulebook you never saw. I pick up on details that other people skim past. I see systems and patterns before I see individual pieces. I sometimes need more time to process what’s going on, especially in noisy or high-demand environments. A lot of “normal” social expectations like unspoken norms, pacing of conversations, and how quickly people expect responses can feel like a constant low-level puzzle I’m solving in the background.</p>

        <p>There were times when that made me feel broken, or at least badly misaligned with what I thought I was supposed to be. It took a while to recognize that my brain wasn’t failing; it was simply working differently than the environment was built for. That difference has brought real challenges, but it has also given me strengths that I lean on every day: the ability to see connections across systems, persistence with complex problems, and empathy for people who find themselves struggling inside structures that weren’t designed with them in mind.</p>

        <h2>Neurodivergence, Work, and Burnout</h2>
        <p>My neurodivergence has shaped how I experience work as much as how I experience school. In emotionally intense environments like veterinary medicine, I felt the weight of compassion fatigue and burnout very quickly. In chaotic or toxic workplaces, like the company where I was doing the work of five people, my sensitivity to unfairness and instability made it hard to ignore what was happening.</p>

        <p>Over time, I’ve learned that I do best in roles where I can lean into my strengths: connecting technical systems with human needs, noticing gaps that others might gloss over, and building processes that make life easier for the people who use them. My current work in systems and admissions technology uses that part of my brain that likes structure and patterns—but it also allows me to keep advocating for the humans inside those systems.</p>

        <h2>Feeling Different in a Global Context</h2>
        <p>One unexpected gift of understanding my neurodivergence has been how it changes the way I experience global and intercultural spaces. In familiar, everyday environments, I often feel like the “odd one out,” interpreting things differently or bumping against norms that don’t make sense to me. But in cross-cultural settings, everyone is navigating something new since everyone has different customs, languages, and expectations. The certainty drops for everyone, not just me.</p>

        <p>In those spaces, my everyday experience of “figuring it out as I go” suddenly feels more shared. The skills I’ve built to navigate difference—observing carefully, asking questions, watching for patterns in how people interact—become useful tools for connecting across cultures. It doesn’t erase the challenges of being neurodivergent, but it does make my way of being feel less like an exception and more like one valid perspective among many others.</p>

        <h2>How It Shapes My Perspective</h2>
        <p>My neurodivergence is not something separate from my cultural identity or my global citizenship; it sits right in the middle of both. It influences how I notice power dynamics, how I respond to unfair systems, and how I think about whose stories are being centered or ignored. It helps me recognize that there is no single “normal” way to move through the world.</p>

        <p>As I keep learning and working, I try to approach my neurodivergence as both a reality to accommodate and a lens that can help me see things differently. It pushes me to be more patient with myself and more compassionate toward others who feel out of place. And it reminds me that the goal isn’t to fit perfectly into a narrow definition of normal, but to find ways to contribute honestly, thoughtfully, and sustainably as the person I actually am.</p>
