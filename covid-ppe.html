      <p class="page-subtitle">A Crisis That Revealed a Divide</p>

   <article class="content-card">

  <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world, the bicycle industry went through one of its most chaotic periods. Our factory partners in China went into lockdown first, and then a few weeks later the U.S. shut down — with one major exception: our warehouse. Suddenly, Americans were buying more bicycles than we had ever seen before. We were working double and triple shifts, shoulder-to-shoulder, in an environment where PPE was nearly impossible to find.</p>

  <h2>Opportunism in a Crisis</h2>

  <p>Right in the middle of that chaos, one of the clearest examples of crisis opportunism came from a U.S. vendor we had worked with for years: the Goldmeiers. While healthcare workers, essential employees, and communities struggled to find even basic protective gear, the Goldmeiers managed to obtain large quantities of PPE and chose to treat the shortage as a business opportunity.</p>

  <p>Instead of helping to ease the strain, they hoarded supplies and inflated prices, turning life-saving equipment into a profit engine. It was jarring to watch, especially knowing how many people were desperate for masks and other protective gear at the time. Eventually, they pled guilty to federal charges for PPE hoarding and price gouging during the national emergency.</p>

  <h2>Compassion From Overseas Partners</h2>

  <p>While all of that was happening, our overseas partners were responding in a completely different way. Our factory contacts in China and other parts of Asia could see the danger we were in. They knew we were still working long hours in close quarters while PPE was nearly impossible to source in the U.S.</p>

  <p>Without being asked, they began sending cartons of masks, gloves, and sanitizers directly to our warehouse. These weren’t marketing gestures or new product samples — they were acts of care. They used their access to essential supplies to protect us, at their own expense, across thousands of miles.</p>

  <p>Those packages arrived like quiet “hero moments” in the middle of a very dark episode. While one long-time U.S. vendor chose profit over people, our international partners chose people over profit. The contrast was impossible to ignore.</p>

  <h2>What This Episode Taught Me</h2>

  <p>Seeing these responses side by side, opportunism from one partner and generosity from others changed my understanding of cultural values more than any lecture or reading ever could. It felt like an 80s cartoon storyline made real: the “villains” using a crisis for personal gain, and the “heroes” stepping in to help simply because it was the right thing to do.</p>

  <p>It taught me that crises expose the deeper layers of culture and character not just in terms of national identity, but in terms of how people see their responsibilities to others. Some approach the world as a shared space where care and reciprocity matter; others see it as a competition for resources and advantage.</p>

  <p>For me, this episode is a reminder that the global economy is made of people, and that culture shapes how those people act when it matters most. It added a sharper, more nuanced color to my understanding of ethics, community, and what it means to be connected across borders.</p>
