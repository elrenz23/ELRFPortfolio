      <p class="page-subtitle">Cross-Cultural Friendship Through Everyday Work</p>

      <article class="content-card">

        <p>Some of the most meaningful cultural experiences of my career didn’t happen in meetings or negotiations, they happened in the quiet rhythm of weekly emails. Every time I sent the latest vendor reports to Minoura LTD in Japan, Takashi Minoura, the owner, wrote back with a little piece of his world. A photo of cherry blossoms over a river. A snapshot from one of his fishing trips. Roadside scenery from rural Japan. Seasonal foods. A calm lake. A moment of daily life captured just because he wanted to share it.</p>

        <p>What started as simple email exchanges slowly became something more personal. Even though we lived on opposite sides of the world and worked in completely different environments, the friendship felt natural, not forced, not formal. Just two people exchanging everyday beauty between spreadsheets and shipping schedules. To this day, Takashi is still one of the first people to wish me a happy birthday.</p>

        <h2>Moments Takashi Shared</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the photos he sent over the years — small windows into life in Japan that made my workdays brighter and reminded me how connected people can be even through something as mundane as vendor reports.</p>

        <h2>A Gift in Return: The Jade Nephrite Fish</h2>

        <p>After COVID restrictions eased and Takashi made a visit to the U.S., I wanted to reciprocate the kindness and connection he had shown me for so many years. I came across a hand-carved nephrite jade fish in a random Facebook Marketplace post — the moment I saw it, I knew it was meant for him. Takashi loves fishing, eating fish, cooking fish… it’s woven deeply into his life. The jade carving felt like the perfect symbol of appreciation: something crafted with intention, shaped by tradition, and tied to something he genuinely loves.</p>

        <p>The joy he expressed in receiving it felt like the completion of a circle; one small act of cultural exchange given back for all the moments he had sent my way. These kinds of gestures, exchanged quietly across borders, helped me understand how international business can grow into something deeply human.</p>

        <h2>What I Learned From This Connection</h2>

        <p>My “Minoura connection” taught me that cultural understanding doesn’t always come from dramatic moments. Sometimes it grows through consistency, kindness, and the willingness to share daily life across distance. Takashi didn’t set out to teach me about Japanese culture but in sharing his world, he did. And in sharing a gift in return, I had the chance to participate in that exchange with meaning and intention.</p>

        <p>It’s easy to see global business as contracts and numbers. But for me, this friendship was a reminder that people make up the global economy — people with hobbies, families, humor, traditions, and hearts. People who send photos of fishing trips. People who get excited about carved jade fish. People who stay in touch, year after year.</p>

        <p>This episode, like so many in my portfolio, added another color to my understanding of the world.</p>
